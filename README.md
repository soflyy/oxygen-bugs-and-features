How to submit a bug report

**BEFORE SUBMITTING A BUG REPORT:** Please try all of the steps listed at https://oxygenbuilder.com/documentation/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-guide/. These steps solve many common issues. If the steps don't solve the problem, proceed.

1. Click "Issues"
2. Click "New Issue"
3. Click "Bug Report"
4. Add a title that briefly describes the bug
5. Fill out the template with the appropriate information.
 **(NOTE: If you can't fill out most fields on the template, don't submit a bug report. Instead, submit a support request via https://oxygenbuilder.com/support and we'll help troubleshoot the problem.)**
6. Click "Submit new issue"

The bug report will be submitted for review. To check the status of your bug report or to check if the bug has already been reported, please check our open bug reports at: https://github.com/soflyy/oxygen-bugs-and-features/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug.
